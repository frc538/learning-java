## Read the Docs

You can read more on println and print:

- [println() - No string](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html#println())
- [println(String)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html#println(java.lang.String))
- [print(String)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html#print(java.lang.String))

## Next Steps

After you get comfortable with print and println, try printing this text:

    +------------------------+
    |                        |
    |      CORNER STORE      |
    |                        |
    | 2015-03-29  04:38PM    |
    |                        |
    | Gallons:       10.870  |
    | Price/gallon: $ 2.089  |
    |                        |
    | Fuel total:   $ 22.71  |
    |                        |
    +------------------------+

You can use any combination of print and println calls you want.
Try doing it several different ways.

Can you do it with just one call?

This example is from [Learn Java The Hard Way](https://learnjavathehardway.org/book/ex02.html). The link will show you an example solution.

You can add lines to the end of the App.java main method to run your code, replace the code inside the main method with your own, or create a new project.
